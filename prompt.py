The content of the code is as follows:
{code_content}

{actual_parameters_or_attributes}
{methods}
{parent_relation}
Please generate a detailed explanation document for this c++ component based on the code of the target object itself.

Please write out the function of this {code_type_tell} in bold plain text, followed by a detailed analysis in plain text (including all details), in english to serve as the documentation for this part of the code.

The standard format which MUST be adhered is as follows:

**Summary**: The functionality of {code_name} is XXX. (Only code name and one sentence function description are required)

* ...
{method_template}

**Code Description**: The description of this {code_type_tell}.
(Detailed and CERTAIN code analysis and description...{has_relationship})
**Note**: Points to note about the use of the code
